# noMUDde
Node.js based MUD client

This is a pretty basic web-based MUD client. I think it sets up a good table to build a robust and feature-rich web client for any MUD.

It currently supports most ANSI color codes (Really complex color sequences get jumbled by the REGEX parser). Not really much else to say. Feel free to check it out at www.darkstonemud.com:8080

Thanks, and let me know what you think.
